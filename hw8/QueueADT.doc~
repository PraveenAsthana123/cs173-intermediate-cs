CS 173: Intermediate Computer Science

Overview:
The Queue class stores and manipulates array via Linked Link. This Queue class supports all the operations for the Queue array including enqueue, dequeue, front and size.

Methods:

Constructors:
Default: A new empty linked list with head pointer pointing NULL and tail pointer pointing NULL
newNode: A new Node data type with value NULL and pointer pointing to NULL
setNode(item, link): Specify a new Node data type by giving its value and pointer link

Operators:
enqueue: The enqueue operation appends the new node in the Node list
dequeue: The dequeue operation removes the first node, returns the value of first node, and make the head pointer pointing to the second node
front: The front operation returns the value of the first node
size: The size operation returns how many nodes are there in the Node list
